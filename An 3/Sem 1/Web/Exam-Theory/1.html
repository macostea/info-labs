    <p> URL </p>
        <p> Abbreviation of Uniform Resource Locator (URL) it is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>The first part of the URL is called a protocol identifier and it indicates what protocol to use, and the second part is called a resource name and it specifies the IP address or the domain name where the resource is located. The protocol identifier and the resource name are separated by a colon and two forward slashes.</p>
        <p>For example, the two URLs below point to two different files at the domain pcwebopedia.com. The first specifies an executable file that should be fetched using the FTP protocol; the second specifies a Web page that should be fetched using the HTTP protocol:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ftp://www.pcwebopedia.com/stuff.exe
            </li>
            <li>
                http://www.pcwebopedia.com/index.html
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>A URL is one type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI); the generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>The term "Web address" is a synonym for a URL that uses the HTTP / HTTPS protocol.</p>
        <p>The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994 and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) URI working group. The URL format is specified in RFC 1738 Uniform Resource Locators (URL).</p>

            Requests data from a specified resource
        </li>
        <li>
            Query strings (name/value pairs) are sent in the URL of a GET request:
        </li>
        <li>
            GET requests can be cached
        </li>
        <li>
            GET requests remain in the browser history
        </li>
        <li>
            GET requests can be bookmarked
        </li>
        <li>
            GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
        </li>
        <li>
            GET requests have length restrictions
        </li>
        <li>
            GET requests should be used only to retrieve data
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

            Query strings (name/value pairs) are sent in the HTTP message body of a POST request:
        </li>
        <li>
            POST requests are never cached
        </li>
        <li>
            POST requests do not remain in the browser history
        </li>
        <li>
            POST requests cannot be bookmarked
