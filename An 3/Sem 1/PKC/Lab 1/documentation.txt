The user can select the encryption key in a special text field.

After writing the Plain text message in the text field, the user can press the encrypt button and the cipher text is shown in the textfield.
After writing the cipher text in the text field, the user can press the decrypt button and the plain text is shown in the textfield.

When pressing either Decrypt or Encrypt the application initialises 2 arrays: 1 with the initial alphabet character by character and one with the encryption key.

When encrypting, the application finds each character in the text field in the initial array and outputs the character at the same index from the encryption key.
When decrypting the same operation is done in reverse using each character from the cipher text.
